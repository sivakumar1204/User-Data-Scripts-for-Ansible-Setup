# Here i had used the Amazon Linux AMI 2 for Ansible Node as well as Ansible Server.
# Taken two EC2 instances one for Ansible-Server and one for Ansible-Node
# Created two user data scripts for Ansible-Server and one for Ansible-Node
# First execute the Ansible-Node.sh script to make the connection of remote server using Password-Based Authentication AWS by default disabled Password-Based Authentication
