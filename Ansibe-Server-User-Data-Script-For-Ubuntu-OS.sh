#Ansible_Server.sh
#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Created user data script for user creation and install ansible and test the connection using ansible ping module in Ansible-Server.sh
# Here i had used the Ubuntu 22 for Ansible Node as well as Ansible Server.
# Taken two EC2 instances one for Ansible-Server and one for Ansible-Node
# Created two user data scripts for Ansible-Server and one for Ansible-Node
# First execute the Ansible-Node.sh script to make the connection of remote server using Password-Based Authentication AWS by default disabled Password-Based Authentication
# Once you login to the server update the default user's password "Ubuntu" 
# Execute below commands
# sudo passwd -d ubuntu
# sudo passwd ubuntu
# sudo usermod -aG ubuntu (Optional)
